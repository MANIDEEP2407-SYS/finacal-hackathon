Not "I want to save more money." That's a wish.
A goal is: "I want {{presentCost}} for {{goalLabel}} in {{years}} years."

At 3.5% for {{years}} years, your savings would grow to roughly {{savingsValue}}.

If {{requiredSIP}} is more than 30% of your income, consider:

By year {{years}}, you will have invested {{totalInvested}} but your corpus will be {{inflatedGoal}} — the difference of {{wealthGained}} is entirely from compounding.

- 2015-16 correction: Fell ~25%, recovered in ~18 months

For your {{years}}-year goal, even a 2-year crash and recovery leaves you with plenty of normal growth afterward. This is why time horizon matters so much.`,

    question: 'How does a SIP work month by month?',
    answer: `Every month on your SIP date:

1. {{requiredSIP}} is debited from your bank account automatically
2. The fund's current NAV determines how many units you get
3. These units are added to your account
4. Your total corpus = all units × current NAV

The monthly compounding is why this calculator uses {{monthlyReturn}}%/month (not {{annualReturn}}%/year) — it's more accurate to how SIPs actually grow.`,

    question: 'What is a step-up SIP?',
    answer: `A step-up SIP increases your monthly investment by a fixed percentage each year.

With {{stepUpRate}}% annual increase, you could achieve the same {{inflatedGoal}} goal starting with just {{stepUpSip}}/month instead of {{requiredSIP}}/month.

That's {{stepUpSaving}} less per month to start — making your goal significantly more achievable today.`,

    question: 'Why does a step-up SIP need less money to start?',
    answer: `Because you invest more in later years when compounding has already been running.

Without step-up: {{requiredSIP}}/month flat
With {{stepUpRate}}% step-up: starts at {{stepUpSip}}

Money invested earlier compounds longer and contributes more per rupee invested. Later money compensates by being a larger amount.`,

    answer: `Missing one SIP month has a calculable but small impact.

You miss investing {{requiredSIP}}.

    question: 'Can I pause or stop my SIP?',
    answer: `Yes — you can pause, reduce, or stop a SIP at any time without penalty.

Your existing corpus continues to grow at {{annualReturn}}% even during the pause — you're just not adding new units.

After resuming, you can make up the shortfall by temporarily increasing your SIP or extending your timeline.

Important: your fund units and gains are safe when you pause. The market continues working on what's already there.`,

    answer: `Four levers you control:

1. EXTEND YOUR TIMELINE (+5 years)
   Current: {{requiredSIP}}/month for {{years}} years
   Extended: {{extendedSip}}/month for {{extendedYears}} years

2. USE STEP-UP SIP ({{stepUpRate}}% annual increase)
   Starting SIP: {{stepUpSip}}/month vs flat {{requiredSIP}}/month

3. CHOOSE LOWER EXPENSE RATIO
   Reducing expense ratio saves money over time

4. REDUCE GOAL SLIGHTLY (−10%)

    answer: `Starting early wins. The math is stark.

At {{annualReturn}}% returns for {{years}} years, your required SIP is {{requiredSIP}}/month.

Starting with even a small SIP today, then increasing it over time, typically outperforms waiting to invest a large amount later.

BASE CASE: {{requiredSIP}}/month flat for {{years}} years

OPTIMIZED:
- Start with a lower SIP using step-up at {{stepUpRate}}%/year
- Target expense ratio of 0.2–0.3%
- Same final corpus: {{inflatedGoal}} ✓

The optimization works because lower early SIP lets compounding do more work, step-up matches income growth, and lower expense ratio keeps more returns in your corpus.`,
